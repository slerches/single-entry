Is a simple record of income and expenses

A separate column is made for each sale item and each expense item, and totaled. 
You can easily know how much you are receiving or spending for each income or expense type.

These separate columns are what make up the ‘accounts’ of a bookkeeping system 
i.e. bank account, stationery account, internet account and so on.

The difference between the Income and Expenses is written just below the 
Income Bank column as the ‘c/f’ figure.
